# IKMB Metagenomic profiling pipeline

## Overview

This pipelines analyses short reads and identifies the most likely species in the respective sample. 

## Executing the pipeline

The pipeline will load most dependencies at run time. You will however need to load the IKMB and Nextflow modules first. After that, do:

`nextflow -c nextflow.config run main.nf --folder /path/to/reads`

where nextflow.config and main.nf need to be passed with their full path to the local git clone. 

If you wish to run the pipeline directly from the git repository on our server:

`nextflow run bfx-core/NF-metagenomic-profiling -hub ikmb --folder /path/to/folder`
